Refactor and optimize the codebase for efficiency and maintainability:

**Modularize:**
- Split monolithic files into logical modules
- Extract config data (portfolio.json)
- Separate concerns (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Use ES6 imports/exports

**Optimize:**
- Remove duplicate code
- Consolidate similar functions
- Reduce bundle size (remove unused code)
- Improve performance (efficient loops, reduce reflows)
- Minimize API calls where possible

**Clean up:**
- Remove dead code
- Simplify complex logic
- Add comments for non-obvious code
- Consistent code style

**Test & commit:**
- Verify all functionality works
- Commit with clear description of improvements

Make everything lean, fast, and maintainable.
