1. Fetch current data for all stocks (price, market cap, P/E)
2. Create a comparison table with key metrics including:
   - % change: 1 week, 1 month, 1 year
   - Analyst consensus (Buy/Hold/Sell) + average price target
   - Volume flag if unusual, note if above/below 50-day MA
3. Note any major news from the past week (earnings, announcements, lawsuits)
4. Write a brief 1-2 sentence summary for each stock
5. Rank them best to worst buy with bullet points and brief reasoning

Keep it factual and straightforward. End with clear ranking.
